# Release Notes

## v3.0

- a new, more powerful JsonApiRelation annotation easing the declarations of relationships.
- QueryParams and Repository annotations have been deprecated (but resource annotations not!) and moved to a legacy package. Interface-based repositories and QuerySpec are the recommended APIs.
- major cleanup release with more test cases.
- some few package changes to non-internal classes and interfaces.
- serialization layer has been completely rewritten and is more robust/easier to understand.
- a new DocumentFilter has been introduced that allows to modify incoming requests and responses.
- many classes considered to be non-public have been moved to internal packages.
- a rewritten servlet integratino for Katharsis based on KatharsisBoot.

Features deprecated with this 3.0 releases remain support for quite some time to come. As such
*Katharsis 3.0 remains backwards compatible with 2.x*. Some small migrations steps are necessary:

- fix package imports
- Replace all usages of QuerySpec<Xy>Repository with <Xy>RepositoryV2.

In the medium/long-term make sure to avoid and drop the usage of any deprecated legacy API (contained in the io.katharsis.legacy packages):

- make use of interface instead of annotation-based repositories.
- make use of QuerySpec instead of QueryParams. You can perform this step gradually. Once that is completed, you can also to the next step.
- move away from DefaultQueryParamsParser in favor of DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer. Note that this step can only be done once
  all the QueryParams-based repositories have been migrated to QuerySpec. This will make your repositories fully JSON-API compliant
  (``sort`` parameter now adheres to the official specification, see below for examples).
- (recommendation) Avoid the use of ``KatharsisProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE`` and rely on a proper dependency management setup instead. Katharsis
  comes out-of-the-box with a CDI and Spring integration, both implementing the ``ServiceDiscovery`` interface.
- make use of ``JsonApiRelation`` instead of ``JsonApiToMany``, ``JsonApiToOne``, ``JsonApiLookupIncludeAutomatically`` and ``JsonApiIncludeByDefault``.

3.1 (soon)
